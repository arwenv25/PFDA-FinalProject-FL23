# Image Information

## Repository Link
https://github.com/arwenv25/PFDA-FinalProject-FL23.git

## Description
This program will analyze an image of the user's choice and output valuable information based on the image. Artists will benefit from this program due to its ability to easily output color profiles as well as general image information.

## Features
- Feature 1: Program will create a color sample block visual based off of five randomized samples from the image's pixels. 
	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.
- Feature 2: Program will analyze pixels for their RGBs and convert five randomized samples from the image's pixels into color names.
	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.
- Feature 3: Program will take the color name and will provide color psychology information based on the color listed.
	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.
- Feature 4: Program will output the image ratio
   	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.
- Feature 5: PRogram will output the image resolution.
  	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.

## Challenges
- I will need to research how to convert RGB to a color name.
- I will need to figure out how to iterate through each pixel in an image.
- I will need to learn how to convert the given colors into color psychology. 

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The program gives the user a menue that offers a color profile option or an image info option. If the user chooses the color profile option the program will analyze the image and output 5 random pixel
  color palette colors, Convert the 5 RGB pixel colors into recognizable color names, and tell the user some color psychology based off of the color.
  If the user chooses the image info option the program will output the image ratio along with the image resolution.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The program analyzes an image and converts the 5 RGB pixel colors into recognizable color names, tells the user some color psychology based off of the color, and outputs the image ratio along with the image resolution.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Goal 1: Work on and finish the menue.
  2. Goal 2: Figure out how to iterate through the pixels.

- Week 2
  1. Goal 1: Create the randomized visual color blocks based on the image's 5 randomized pixel samples.
  2. Goal 2: Code the color conversion from RGB to recognizable color names, assign colors and pschological affects.

- Week 3 (Final)
  1. Goal 1: Code the image ratio and resolution.
  2. Goal 2: Finalize and record video.
