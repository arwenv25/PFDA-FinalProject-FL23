Image Insights is a program that allows the user to get information about a given image based upon a menu selection. The program when run will give the user a menu with two options. If the first option is selected the program will grab the image's five most dominant colors, the RGB values based on the five most dominant colors, convert the five most dominant colors to common color names, and provide the user with a pop up window with a little sample of the five colors. If the second option is selected, the program will get the imageâ€™s ratio and its resolution and output it for the user.
