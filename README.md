## Description 
  Should be a few paragraphs in length and explain what your project is, what your different files you include in your repository, any design considerations, future areas of improvements, etc. Written explaination of your project. 
Image Insights is a program that allows the user to get information about a given image based upon a menu selection. The program when run will give the user a menu with two options. If the first option is selected the program will grab the image's five most dominant colors, the RGB values based on the five most dominant colors, convert the five most dominant colors to common color names, and provide the user with a pop up window with a little sample of the five colors. If the second option is selected, the program will get the imageâ€™s ratio and its resolution and output it for the user.
  The files included in my src folder are as follows: the code file, hollywood.jpg (a demo image for the program), rainbow.jpg (another demo image), and rgb.jpg (the yet another demo image). Aside from the files in my src file, my repository contains a proposal document that explains the initial program idea, a README file (this file you're currently reading), and a requirements text file that includes all the 3rd party libraries needed for the program. Some of the future areas of improvements would be to add the color psychology as well as create the menu in a separate window with physical buttons that the user can click instead of having to type everything in the terminal.
